<h1>o2jkveri's Image renamer.</h1> 
Hi. This is just a small program. 
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  I had the necesity to rename some images in numerical order, since I was too lazy to do that (some folders contained above 1k images). <br>
  So I created this program on python, with the os module of python. So I had to learn how to use it. <br>
  And what you see is the result.
  
</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Execute the program on a console (Obviously, having Python 3.8+ installed)</li>
    <li>Put the path to the <strong>folder</strong> (not an individual image) you want to rename the files (The images have to be .jpg, .jpeg, .png).</li>
    <li>Enter, and the program will start renaming the files.</li>
  </ol>
